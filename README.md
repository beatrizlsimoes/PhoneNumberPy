# Phone Number Location
This Python program uses the phonenumbers library and the Google Geocoding API to determine the approximate location of a phone number and obtain its specific address.

## Usage
1. Open the "PNlocation.py" file in a text editor.
2. Replace the "phone_number" variable with the phone number you want to locate.
3. Save the changes to the file.
4. Open a terminal window in the directory where the PNlocation.py file is located.
5. Run the program by typing "python3 PNlocation.py" and pressing Enter.
6. The program will output the approximate location of the phone number and its specific address, if available. If an error occurs, the program will print a detailed error message.

## Note
Feel free to use and modify it as you see fit.
